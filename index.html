    <p>Coaching Built by and for Night Shift Workers — Real, Practical, and Proven</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a certified addiction counselor and former life coach for professionals at a university. I’ve run a sober companionship business and helped individuals overcome addiction and burnout. I’ve driven trucks myself, so I know firsthand the stress, exhaustion, and mental toll it can take. I studied recovery, sleep, and stress with some of the top doctors and experts. And I’ve helped families, students, and professionals rediscover their strength and purpose. My mission is to help night shift workers become the strongest, healthiest version of themselves — physically, emotionally, spiritually, and mentally.</p>

    <h2>Common Objections</h2>
    <p>"Will this really help someone like me?" — Yes. Everything I do is not only evidence-based, but tested in real life. I’ve worked in trucking. I’ve been through burnout. I’ve been the one people call when things fall apart. This works because it’s built on real experience.</p>
    <p>"What if I’m too far gone?" — No one is. I’ve helped people recover, get strong, and live again — from working men dealing with addiction to professionals balancing family and stress.</p>

    <h2>Real Impact</h2>
    <p>I’ve led group and one-on-one coaching programs that have reached over 3,000 people — including lectures on recovery and hands-on guidance. Families have hired me to move in and help a loved one overcome addiction, rebuild their mindset, and strengthen their faith. I’ve worked one-on-one with university students and now focus on night shift workers and truckers looking for real transformation.</p>
